# CTOSS Library

CTOSS (Customizable Table Object Sorting and Searching) is an advanced filtering library built for seamless integration with AgGrid but can also be used as a standalone tool. It is designed to consume JSON or POCO models and supports filtering for numbers, strings, and dates. Future updates will include support for other AgGrid filter types.
